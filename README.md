# Odin-Recipes
## Releasing the 1.0 version of "My Recipes Repository" 
## Few things that I must clarify from my side
    1. My first project for Odin Project
    2. Minimal of graphics till date
    3. Used only HTML to structure the page
## Where do I stand?
    1. Even if I know definitely more CSS than this, I decided to go along with Odin Project only.
    2. Even though complexities can be added, intentionally kept simple.
    3. Would be regularly updated as I move along the Odin Project Curriculum[https://www.theodinproject.com/].
    4. All the content rights are with allrecipes.com[https://www.allrecipes.com/], its just another content repurposing exercise
## Methods used
    1. used target="blank" attribute of HTML anchor tag, for better CSS
    2. used proper folder structures
    3. used Kebab-Case and a mix of smallcase kebab-case.
    4. Broken down things into smaller parts for better understanding of recipes.
